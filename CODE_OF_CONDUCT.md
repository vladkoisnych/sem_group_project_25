# Code of Conduct

> By joining the group every group member agrees to the code of conduct and will follow it to the best of their ability.

## Use of technology
Any usage of University technology and/or technology from fellow group members should be responsible. Any damage to said items shall be paid for. During the meetings the technology is to be used for the group project itself, illegal and/or harmful activities will not be tolerated and such actions will be reported to the responsible parties. 

## Plagiarism
Any items, code snippets, texts and so forth should be marked and referenced accordingly by the member introducing said things to the group project. If it comes to the attention of the group that a individual has plagiarized any part of the work it will be reported to the lecturer and further work with the individual in question will be halted. Any references are to be made according to university standards. 

## Dress code
There is no official dress code to be enforced, however it is expected that members will dress in casual daily wear. While PJ’s are not forbidden it is expected that all members wear something appropriate given that meeting will take place in public spaces.

## Absenteeism and tardiness
All members are expected to attend the 2 meetings each week. It will be marked if they are absent if not given any excuse. If any member refuses to attend these meetings and doesn’t contribute to the project they will be reported to the lecturer. Members are expected to do their assigned tasks on time as to not hinder development by other members. 

## Job duties and respect
Assigned tasks are to be completed within the time frame given due to the remainder of group being restricted in their work if any task has not been completed. We expect everyone to work together as a team and to respect each other and those around us. Noise levels should be kept to a minimum as to not disturb other users of the facility we are working in. If the situation arises in which one member cannot accept this they will be asked to adhere to the rules and if they cannot do this they will be asked to leave the group.

## Disciplinary action
Consequences of breaking the code of conduct will vary depending on what section was broken. If it is a minor thing it will be talked out within the group, the next step of action will be to report said member to the right authority. This could lead to exclusion from the group and based on the severity of the rule break direct contact with police or the university team.
